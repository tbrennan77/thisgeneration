# This Generation Wordpress Theme

This is a custom WordPress theme for Christian Media International (CMI). The goal of CMI is to reach the world with the gospel in this generation. The theme name is taken from that mission statement.

The theme is built on the [Sage template](https://roots.io/sage) from Roots.io. The development is being led by [Tim Brennan](https://github.com/tbrennan77) with design by Brandon McCurdy. The technical documentation that is specific to Sage is located in the `wp-content/themes/thisgeneration` directory. Please reference that for specific functionality questions, install, setup and running this project locally.
